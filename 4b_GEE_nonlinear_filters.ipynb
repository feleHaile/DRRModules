    "In previous noteboooks, we applied convolutional filters.  Those filter compute a linear combination of pixels in a neighborhood(specified by the window shape) according to the weights specified by the kernel. Non-linear functions applied to a neighborhood are also useful. [Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter) and [mode](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/metip/tutor/tutor.Filtering.html)  are examples of non linear filters.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Median filters are useful for removing noise in an image, especially pixel values with no relation to the image scene. Suppose that random pixels in the image are saturated by anomalously high or low values that result from some noise process. Filtering the image with a mean filter (previous notebook) would result in pixels values getting polluted by noisy data. The median filter ranks the pixels in the neighborhood from lowest to highest and selects the median value, which is then placed in the central value of the mask. \n",

    "An approach to apply nonlinear filters in GEE is by using the function *reduceNeighborhood()*. \n"

However, when the interest rely on objects (connected group of pixels)  present in the image rather than individual pixels, we may use [morphological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology).
